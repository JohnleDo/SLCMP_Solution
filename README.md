## How To Run solution.py
Make sure to have python3 installed, should work with any version. Version I have tested on so far is Python 3.6.5 on a linux OS and Windows OS. Clone down the repo and `cd` into the directory where there is the csv files and the `solution.py` and `testcase_solution.py`. Then run either of these commands to run the solution:
 
 Linux
 ```
 python solution.py
 python3 solution.py
 ```
 Windows (from powershell)
  ```
 python .\solution.py
 python3 .\solution.py
 ```
